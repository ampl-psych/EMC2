\description{
Model file to estimate the Racing Diffusion Model (RDM), also known as the Racing Wald Model.
}
\details{
Model files are almost exclusively used in \code{design()}.

Default values are used for all parameters that are not explicitly listed in the \code{formula}
argument of \code{design()}.They can also be accessed with \code{RDM()$p_types}.\tabular{llllll}{

All parameters are estimated on the log scale.

The parameterization \emph{b} = \emph{B} + \emph{A} ensures that the response threshold is
always higher than the between trial variation in start point.

Conventionally, \code{s} is fixed to 1 to satisfy scaling constraints.

Because the RDM is a race model, it has one accumulator per response option.
EMC2 automatically constructs a factor representing the accumulators \code{lR} (i.e., the
latent response) with level names taken from the \code{R} column in the data.

The \code{lR} factor is mainly used to allow for response bias, analogous to \emph{Z} in the
DDM. For example, in the RDM, response thresholds are determined by the \emph{B}
parameters, so \code{B~lR} allows for different thresholds for the accumulator
corresponding to "left" and "right" stimuli, for example, (e.g., a bias to respond left occurs
if the left threshold is less than the right threshold).

For race models in general, the argument \code{matchfun} can be provided in \code{design()}.
One needs to supply a function that takes the \code{lR} factor (defined in the augmented data (d)
in the following function) and returns a logical defining the correct
response. In the example below, this is simply whether the \code{S} factor equals the
latent response factor: \code{matchfun=function(d)d$S==d$lR}. Using \code{matchfun} a latent match factor (\code{lM}) with
levels \code{FALSE} (i.e., the stimulus does not match the accumulator) and \code{TRUE}
(i.e., the stimulus does match the accumulator). This is added internally
and can also be used in model formula, typically for parameters related to
the rate of accumulation.
