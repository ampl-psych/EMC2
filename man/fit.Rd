  emc,
  stage = NULL,
  iter = 1000,
  stop_criteria = NULL,
  search_width = 1,
  step_size = 100,
  verbose = TRUE,
  fileName = NULL,

}
\arguments{
\item{emc}{An emc object created with \code{make_emc},
or a path to where the emc object is stored.}

\item{stage}{A string. Indicates which stage to start the run from, either \code{preburn}, \code{burn}, \code{adapt} or \code{sample}.
If unspecified, it will run the subsequent stage (if there is one).}

\item{iter}{An integer. Indicates how many iterations to run in the sampling stage.}

\item{stop_criteria}{A list. Defines the stopping criteria and for which types
of parameters these should hold. See the details and examples section.}

\item{search_width}{A double. Tunes target acceptance probability of the MCMC process.
This fine-tunes the width of the search space to obtain the desired acceptance probability.
1 is the default width, increases lead to broader search.}

\item{step_size}{An integer. After each step, the stopping requirements as specified
by \code{stop_criteria} are checked and proposal distributions are updated. Defaults to 100.}

\item{verbose}{Logical. Whether to print messages between each step with the current status regarding the \code{stop_criteria}.}

\item{fileName}{A string. If specified, will auto-save emc object at this location on every iteration.}

\item{particle_factor}{An integer. \code{particle_factor} multiplied by the square
root of the number of sampled parameters determines the number of particles used.}

\item{cores_per_chain}{An integer. How many cores to use per chain. Parallelizes across
participant calculations. Only available on Linux or Mac OS. For Windows, only
parallelization across chains (\code{cores_for_chains}) is available.}

\item{cores_for_chains}{An integer. How many cores to use across chains.
Defaults to the number of chains. The total number of cores used is equal to \code{cores_per_chain} * \code{cores_for_chains}.}

\item{max_tries}{An integer. How many times should it try to meet the finish
conditions as specified by \code{stop_criteria}? Defaults to 20. \code{max_tries} is
ignored if the required number of iterations has not been reached yet.}

\item{thin}{A boolean. If \code{TRUE} will automatically thin the MCMC samples, closely matched to the ESS.
Can also be set to a double, in which case 1/thin of the chain will be removed (does not have to be an integer).}

\item{...}{Additional optional arguments}
}
\value{
An emc object
}
\description{
General purpose function to estimate models specified in EMC2.
}
\details{
\code{stop_criteria} is either a list of lists with names of the stages,
or a single list in which case its assumed to be for the sample \code{stage} (see examples).
The potential stop criteria to be set are:

\code{selection} (character vector): For which parameters the \code{stop_criteria} should hold

\code{mean_gd} (numeric): The mean Gelman-Rubin diagnostic across all parameters in the selection

\code{max_gd} (numeric): The max Gelman-Rubin diagnostic across all parameters in the selection

\code{min_unique} (integer): The minimum number of unique samples in the MCMC chains across all parameters in the selection

\code{min_es} (integer): The minimum number of effective samples across all parameters in the selection

\code{omit_mpsrf} (Boolean): Whether to include the multivariate point-scale reduction factor in the Gelman-Rubin diagnostic. Default is \code{FALSE}.

\code{iter} (integer): The number of MCMC samples to collect.

The estimation is performed using particle-metropolis within-Gibbs sampling.
