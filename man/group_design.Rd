\title{Create Group-Level Design Matrices}
\usage{
group_design(formula, data, subject_design, contrasts = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{formula}{A list of formulas specifying the relationship between subject-level parameters
and group-level predictors. Each formula should have a subject-level parameter on the left-hand side
and group-level predictors on the right-hand side.}

\item{data}{The same data as used in the subject-level design. Must include a 'subjects' column.}

\item{subject_design}{An emc.design object containing the subject-level design.}

\item{contrasts}{Optional list of contrast matrices to be used for categorical predictors.}
}
\value{
A list of design matrices, one for each parameter specified in the formula. The intercept is
automatically included as the group-level mean and is omitted from the design matrices.
}
\description{
Creates design matrices for group-level parameters based on subject-level design and formulas.
This function is used for hierarchical modeling to specify how subject-level parameters
vary across groups or conditions.
}
\details{
The function checks that all parameters in the formula exist in the subject-level design,
and that all predictors exist in the data. It also verifies that each subject has exactly
one level of each factor predictor, as required for group-level modeling.

\examples{
# Create subject-level design
subj_design <- design(data = forstmann, model = DDM,
                      formula = list(v ~ S, a ~ E, t0 ~ 1),
                      contrasts = list(S = contr.helmert))
# Add some age covariate
forstmann$age <- as.numeric(forstmann$subjects) + 30
# Create fake group column
forstmann$group <- ifelse(forstmann$subjects \%in\% unique(forstmann$subjects)[seq(1, 19, 2)], "A", "B")

# Create group-level design matrices
group_matrices <- group_design(
  formula = list(v_S1 ~ age + group, a ~ age),
  data = forstmann,
  subject_design = subj_design,
  contrasts = list(group = contr.bayes)
)
