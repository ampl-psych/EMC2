Model files are almost exclusively used in \code{design()}.

Default values are used for all parameters that are not explicitly listed in the \code{formula}
argument of \code{design()}.They can also be accessed with \code{SShybrid()$p_types}.\tabular{llllll}{

All parameters are estimated on the log scale, with the exception of the attentional failure parameters (\code{tf} and \code{gf}), which are estimated on the probit scale.

The parameterization \emph{b} = \emph{B} + \emph{A} ensures that the response threshold is
always higher than the between trial variation in start point.

Conventionally, \code{s} is fixed to 1 to satisfy scaling constraints.

Because the ex-Gaussian stop signal model is a race model, it has one accumulator per response option.
EMC2 automatically constructs a factor representing the accumulators \code{lR} (i.e., the
latent response) with level names taken from the \code{R} column in the data.

For race models, the \code{design()} argument \code{matchfun} can be provided, a
function that takes the \code{lR} factor (defined in the augmented data (d)
in the following function) and returns a logical defining the correct response.
In the example below, the match is simply such that the \code{S} factor equals the
latent response factor: \code{matchfun=function(d)d$S==d$lR}. Then \code{matchfun} is
used to automatically create a latent match (\code{lM}) factor with
levels \code{FALSE} (i.e., the stimulus does not match the accumulator) and \code{TRUE}
(i.e., the stimulus does match the accumulator). This is added internally
and can also be used in model formula.

This hybrid race model of the stop signal task was introduced in Tanis et al. (2024).

Note that, in contrast to the parameters of the go process, the ex-Gaussian stop process parameters \code{muS}, \code{sigmaS}, and \code{tauS} do not have clear psychological interpretations (Matzke & Wagenmakers, 2009).
Matzke et al. (2020) showed that evidence accumulation models of the stop process have poor psychometric properties.
Thus, this hybrid race model - with an evidence accumulation account of \emph{going} and a descriptive account of \emph{stopping} - represents a compromise between process realism and practically useful measurement properties (Tanis et al., 2024).

The mean of the ex-Gaussian stop distribution (\code{muS + tauS}) is taken as the stop signal reaction time (SSRT).

The ex-Gaussian distribution has support on the real line \eqn{\left(-\infty, \infty\right)}.
To prevent evaluation of impossible (i.e., negative) or implausibly fast stop finish times, lower truncation is applied to the stop finish time distribution using the parameter \code{exgS_lb}.
The default value for this lower bound is \code{.05}, based on empirical estimates of the onset latency of early sensory processing (Schmolesky et al., 1998) and in line with Tanis et al. (2024).
