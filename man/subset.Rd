\arguments{
\item{pmwgs}{An emc object}

\item{thin}{scalar integer, thinning interval}

\item{keep_last}{logical, default FALSE, if TRUE apply keep from last iteration}

\item{filter}{character, default "sample", the stage from which to select samples,
if NULL select on absolute iteration number (including "init" which is iteration 1)}

\item{only_keep_filter}{logical default TRUE, keep samples only from
filter stage, empty all other stages, if FALSE apply selection only to stage
specified in filter, keep all other staged (ignored if filter=NULL).}
