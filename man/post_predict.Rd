\usage{
post_predict(
  samples,
  hyper = FALSE,
  n_post = 100,
  expand = 1,
  filter = "sample",
  subfilter = 0,
  thin = 1,
  n_cores = 1,
  use_par = c("random", "mean", "median")[1]
)
}
\arguments{
\item{samples}{A list of samples from which you want to generate posterior predictives.}

\item{hyper}{Boolean. Default is FALSE, if true simulates from the group level.}

\item{n_post}{Integer. How many data sets do you want to generate from the posterior.}

\item{expand}{Integer. Default is 1, exact same design for each subject. Larger values will replicate designs, so more trials per subject.}

\item{filter}{Character. Choice of the stages 'pre-burn', 'burn', 'adapt', 'sample', default is 'sample'. From which stage do you want to take samples to generate new data with.}

\item{subfilter}{Integer or numeric vector. If integer, will filter out the first x of samples, within your filter. If numeric vector will select those samples, within your filter.}

\item{thin}{Integer. By how much do you want to thin the chains before simulating from them.}

\item{n_cores}{Integer. Across how many cores do you want to parallelize.}

\item{use_par}{Character. Can be mean, median or default random. Will take either random samples from the chain or as specified.}
}
\value{
A list of simulated data sets of length n_post.
