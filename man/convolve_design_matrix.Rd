\usage{
convolve_design_matrix(
  timeseries,
  events,
  factors = NULL,
  contrasts = NULL,
  covariates = NULL,
  add_constant = TRUE,
  hrf_model = "glover + derivative",

)
}
\arguments{
\item{timeseries}{A data frame containing fMRI time series data with columns 'subjects', 'run', 'time', and at least one ROI column}

\item{events}{A data frame containing event information with required columns \code{subjects}, \code{run}, \code{onset}, \code{duration}, \code{event_type}, and \code{modulation}}

\item{factors}{A named list mapping factor names to event types}

\item{contrasts}{A named list of contrast matrices for each factor}

\item{covariates}{A character vector of event types to include as covariates}

\item{add_constant}{A boolean specifying whether a 1 should be included to the design matrix post convolution}

\item{hrf_model}{A character string specifying the HRF model to use ('glover', 'spm', 'glover + derivative', or 'spm + derivative')}

\item{cell_coding}{A character vector of factor names to use cell coding for}

\item{scale}{A boolean indicating whether to scale the design matrix.}

\item{high_pass}{Logical indicating whether to apply high-pass filtering.
Alternatively, specifying 'add' adds the regressors to the design matrix}

\item{high_pass_model}{Character indicating which type of high-pass filtering to apply ('cosine', 'poly')}

\item{cut_off}{A numeric value specifying the cutoff for the high-pass filter}
}
\value{
A list containing the design matrices
}
\description{
This function convolves events with the HRF to construct design matrices for fMRI analysis.

# Generate a simple example timeseries
