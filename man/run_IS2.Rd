\title{Runs IS2 from Tran et al. 2021 on a list of samplers}
\usage{
run_IS2(
  samplers,
  filter = "sample",
  subfilter = 0,
  IS_samples = 1000,
  stepsize_particles = 500,
  max_particles = 5000,

)
}
\arguments{
\item{samplers}{A list of samplers}

\item{filter}{A string. Indicates which stage to take samples from}

\item{subfilter}{An integer or vector. If integer specifies how many samples to remove from within that stage. If vector used as index for samples to keep.}

\item{IS_samples}{An integer. Specifies how many IS2 samples to collect}

\item{stepsize_particles}{An integer. It will increase particles till optimal variance with this stepsize.}

\item{max_particles}{An integer. Specifies the maximum number of particles to collect before stopping one IS iteration.}

\item{n_cores}{An integer. Specifies how many cores to run IS_2 on.}

\item{df}{An integer. The degrees of freedom used in the t-distribution used as IS distribution for the group-level proposals.}
}
\value{
Samplers, with IS2 attribute
}
\description{
Runs IS2 on a list of samplers, only works for types standard, factor and diagonal yet.
