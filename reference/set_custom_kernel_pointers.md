# (Re-)Set pointers of custom C++ trend kernels to an emc object

When an emc object is loaded from disk, or returned by forked processes,
the pointers to custom kernels need to be re-created. This is a
convenience function to do this.

## Usage

``` r
set_custom_kernel_pointers(emc, ptrs)
```

## Arguments

- emc:

  An emc object

- ptrs:

  A list of pointers, as generated by
  [`get_custom_kernel_pointers()`](https://ampl-psych.github.io/EMC2/reference/get_custom_kernel_pointers.md)

## Value

An emc object with the custom pointers re-instated.
